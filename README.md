# EncryptedFileDrop 

This application focuses on the protection, confidentiality, and integrity of users’ data. 
Files are encrypted on the client side before they are transmitted and stored on a private server. 
Only intended users may decrypt and access the contents of the data. 

Use case:
A company wants to securely exchange sensitive messages and files internally without relying on third-party
services like email, Google Drive, Dropbox, Signal, etc. In order to maintain full control over their 
data and enforce internal security policies, they deploy their own secure file drop system.
